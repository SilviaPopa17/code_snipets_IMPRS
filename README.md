# Description of files 

line_fitting_0.py, tem_den_diagnsotics.py and 4_Analysis.ipynb are scripts 
that I wrote for my ongoing master thesis. 

line_fitting_0.py:
Fitting of lines, computing integrated intensity, S/N, 
fwhm and errors of the diagnostic emission lines

tem_den_diagnostics.py:
Determination of temperature and density of ionized gas using 
line intensity ratios of diagnostic lines 

4_Analysis.ipynb:
Analysis for my ongoing master thesis

analysis_simulations.ipynb:
Analysis of the galaxy stellar content of the output two cosmological hydrodynamic 
zoom-in simulation of a massive dark matter halo at z=0 (with and without AGN feedback) 
with the goal to analyze the impact of AGN feedback on the properties of the galaxy

runge_kutta.ipynb:
4th order Runge Kutta method for 3-body problem
