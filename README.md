# Description of files 

analysis_simulations.ipynb:
Analysis of the galaxy stellar content of two cosmological hydrodynamic 
zoom-in simulation of a massive dark matter halo at z=0. The simulation 
has been run with and without AGN feedback and this exercise has the goal
to analyze the impact of AGN feedback on the properties of the galaxy.

line_fittin_0.pu, tem_den_diagnsotics.py and 4_Analyssi.ipynb are scripts 
that I am using for my ongoing master thesis. 

line_fitting_0.py:
Code that fits lines and saves integrated intensity, S/N, 
fwhm and errors of the diagnostic emission lines

tem_den_diagnostics.py:
Code that determines temperature and density diagnostics using 
line intensity ratios of diagnostic lines 

4_Analysis.ipynb:
Analysis for my ongoing master thesis


runge_kutta.ipynb:
4th order Runge Kutta method for 3-body problem
